# ReplayPosition
 
A single script replay system that simply records a target's position and then replays it. Once the target has moved from its starting point the follower script will then begin its replay system. 

Target: Transform that the follower will imitate
Point Update Rate: Frequency that the follower will record target positions 
Points: Recorded points the follower will interpolate between 
Replay Speed: Modifies the speed at which the replay system will execute 
Pause On First Move: How long the follower will wait upon its target's first movement
